# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Time-series-analysis

Introduction to Stock Market Prediction:
Stock market unpredictability and the involvement of numerous stakeholders necessitate effective forecasting techniques.
Machine learning, particularly Time Series (TS) analysis, has been employed for stock market prediction.

Data Stationarity Assessment:
Initial step involves checking historical stock market data for stationarity.
Techniques like Plotting Rolling Statistics and the Dickey-Fuller Test are employed for this purpose.

Trend and Seasonality Elimination:
To enhance predictability, trends and seasonality are removed from the time series data.
This transforms the data into a stationary series, providing a more stable foundation for analysis.

ARIMA Model Application:
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is chosen for its efficiency in financial and economic sectors.
ARIMA serves as a stochastic model suitable for short-term stock market predictions.

Subclass Analysis:
ARIMA model subclasses - Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) - are applied.
Comparative analysis of these subclasses is conducted to assess their individual performance.

Forecasted Value Transformation:
The forecasted values are converted back to the original scale.
This involves reintroducing trend and seasonality constraints for a more meaningful interpretation of predictions.

Overall Approach Summary:
Leveraging time series analysis, stationarity checks, and the ARIMA model provides a systematic approach for navigating the complexities of stock market dynamics.
The goal is to enhance the accuracy of short-term stock market predictions through a well-structured methodology.
